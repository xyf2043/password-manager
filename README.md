# Password Manager

## Overview about the project

This application, *password manager*, aims to help record password (with its username) on 
website accounts, credit cards, etc. 

**Password Manager** could record both password and username at the same time as a user.

This application could assist people **who need**:
- to remember many passwords or usernames for accounts on websites, cards, and so on.
- to ensure privacy, since the password-record function on website browser is not so safe.
- convenience, for example, just search for either username or password in the project list, both of them would
appear. There is also a 'delete' and 'edit' function to delete or change passwords and usernames.


## Why I interested in this project?

I create this project because I once faced the trouble with passwords on the website
accounts. Sometimes I would forget username, or sometimes I would forget passwords.
However, using same password for each account would lead to a loss to security of accounts. 
With the password manager, I believe the application would solve these potential problems.
