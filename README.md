# Password Manager

## Overview about the project

This project, *password manager*, aims to help record password (with its user name) on 
website accounts, credit cards, etc. 

This password manager could assist people **who need**:
- to remember many passwords for their accounts on websites, cards, and so on.
- to ensure privacy, since the password-record function on website browser is not so safe.
- convenience, for example, just search for either username or password in the project list, both of them would
appear.

## Why I interested in this project?

I create this project because I once faced the trouble with passwords on the website
accounts. Sometimes I would forget username, or sometimes I would forget passwords.
However, using same password for each account would lead to a loss to account security. 
Therefore, with the password manager, I believe the application would solve these 
potential problems.
